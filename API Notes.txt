What is API ?
Application Programming Interface, that connect two application with the help of api to connect with each other.
intermediate application.


* Any website or app contains 3 layers :
	1- Presentation Layer "UI" user interface layer."front End"
	2-Application Layer."Web Server" "contains the images and some methods for the app"
	3- Data Base Layer, all the info stored as a table


how many types of API?
1- internal API 
2- Partner API

What tool do you use to test API ?
Postman tool.

## in API we do not write codes we send requests.

What is Agile?   
is a method where the software is divided into multiple portions or small small parts 
and each part is developed and tested and sent to the client.


When I divid the total time into a smaller timeframe and within a smaller timeframe 
we develop and test the small parts and make working software and send it to the client  this process called Agile Scrum.

Agile Scrum follows 3-5-3 rules
	1. 3 rules: a-P.O or B.A  b- Scrum Master c- Development team"developer and testers"
	2. 5 meetings: a- Grooming Meeting b- Sprint Planning Meeting c-Daily Stand Up
		d- Sprint Review Meeting e- Retrospective Meeting (PI Planning Meeting , Defect Triage Meeting, QA SignOff 				Meeting , Release Planning Meeting)
	3. 3 Artifact : a- Product Backlog  b- Sprint Backlog  c- Release Backlog


What do we do in Grooming meeting?
we analyze stories, periortize size.

What we do in Sprint Planning Meeting?
we discuss what are stories are picked for the upcoming sprint.

What we get asked in Stand Up Meeting?
What did I do yesterday , What I am going to do today and is there is any difficulties Facing me"blockers or stopers"


Who is the owner of ProductBacklog?
P.O or B.A


Who is the owner of Sprint Backlog?
Developing team ."Developer and testers.

## After Grooming Meeting we get Product Backlog , After Sprint Planning Meeting we get Sprint Backlog

Kanban: there is no timeframe, we only divid the application into small small parts and build together"means build and test".




Who give us stories?
B.A OR P.O 


Epic is a large requirement by the Client, P.O and B.A will divid the requirment tnto a smaller requirments.
each small requirment called a story.
under one Epic we get many stories.


Who works on stories day by day?
developers and testers.

Who helps developer and testers daily ?
test lead , developer lead, delivery manager, tech team,scrum muster, P.O and B.A

where do they keep stories?
in Backlog.


Who explains stories?
P.O and B.A

Who ask questions about the stories?
the whole team.


What is the name of the meeting that the team can ask questions about the stories?
Grooming meeting, 


What is the story point in Jira?
it means Time and effort, what time and effort do you need.


What is sprint planning meeting?
the meeting that we decied which story we will be working in the next sprint.
or how many sprints we will work in the next sprint.



What ever we test "API or UI" we must test DataBase too.



When the points number is higher it means the sory needs more time and effort.



Developers and Testers are the ones who decide the # of points per a story.



The Swagger Documents are given by the developer.


Testers should get the Swagger Documents before they stert working.


Where do we Execute Test cases?
In Postman


API testing process?
1. analyze the story
2. analyzing the ac
3.analyze Swagger doc
4.analyze mapping doc
5. writing test senarios and test cases
6. creating test data environmnent/set up the environment 
7. in our environment we execute test cases.




What is the flow ?
Api, web server, Database server.


What are the components to send a post request?
1. Endpoints (URL"Unified Resource Locator" when we use UI 
	.../ URI "Unified Resource Identifier" when postman acts like UI" invisible for users")
2. Headers (Athorization)
3.Body (Pay Load)


#########Why do we use environment variable is poatman?########
so if the baseURL changes we save time by change it once, so we change it in the environment that will be reflected in all of the request


What is the BaseURL?
the url address that repeated in all the urls.
after the BaseURL before the ? that portion calls Path Parameter
after the ? calls Query Parameter



What API I use?
Rest(Architecture API) or Restful API "is test API using Postman
SOAP is an API but it is a protocol"follows some rules"


What is the different between API that uses internet and without?
Webservice used internet. all Web Service is API
, not all API is webservice
API is two types : over the internet and without internet.


What is API testing?
Testing the core business logic is API Testing, we send a request from a client like Postman and we receive response
from the server.


We call API Business Logic.



What is API Integrations?
API Integrations are softwares components that automatically update data between clients and server.


Endpoint VS API?
they are not the same thing,
Endpoint is a component of API.
API is a set of rules that allows two applications to share the same resources.
Endpoints are the location of the resources.
API uses Endpoint's URL to retrieve the requested resources.



What is Header?
Extra source of information for each API call / API request / http request / HTTP Method
when user create an API, he adds some particular key and value should be added to each of the call/request
to get API to response like API Keys and Language , like Application Json , cashes , cookies and Project Information. 



What is Body?
When we need to send Data to the API, we send it as request body such as Post , Put we use body to send the resource.


201 we say 2not1
so 0 is not


What is Health Check in API?
to check the minimum viable Health of API, we can send a Get request that response back if the server is available.



What are the HTTP Methods that we use for an API?
GET :retrieve resource
POST : creates a resource
PUT : update an exsisting resource
PATCH : update a partial resource
DELETE : remove a resource


Difference between PUT and PATCH?
Put will update  the whole thing
PATCH will update a patial data



##Json is Java Script Object Notation



						2xx = successful
			200 -- Successfully OK
			201 -- Successfully Created
			204 -- Successfully Connected but the content is not available 


						4xx = Unsuccessful because of the request error
			400 -- Very Very Very bad request
			401 -- Unothorized "Invalid Authorization"
			404 -- Requested Resource not found "problem with the path parameter"

						5xx = Problem with the server Level
			500 -- Server Error "entered into the server but server has some problems to handle/process my request"
			501 -- Getway Timout "tried to connect with the server ..and at one point it returns Gateway Timeout"
			


### What do we validate in API?
1- we validate data code
2- we validate statues String (ok, created, very bad request)
3- if we need to validate any particular String
4- We validate Feild and Value
5- Checking response header content type
6- Check if the response time is less that 200ms




					Reqress Collection Tests
	A. List Users "Get Method"
		1- Test Case 001 - Verify that the user get 200 response in a Get Method
		2- Test Case 001 - Verify that the status code name has String OK
		3- Test Case 003 - Verify that length of users of page2 is 6
		4- Test Case 004 - Verify that the user in page2
		5- Test Case 005 - Verify that Byron is included in my string Byron
		6- Test Case 006 - Verify that Content Type is Present
		7- Test Case 007 - Response time is less than 200ms
		8- Test Case 008 - Verify that the response time is less that 200ms


	B. Create "Post Method"
		1- Test Case 101 - Verify that the user gets 201 response in a Post Method
		2- Test Case 101 - Verify that the status code name has String Created
		3- Test Case 103 - Verify that morpheus is included in my string
		4- Test Case 104 - Verify that Content Type is Present
		5- Test Case 105 - "Verify that the response time is less that 500ms
		6- Test Case 106 - Verify that the key job got value of leader
		



My API Key for NewsAPI.org is :  f262b475d8a24ccca7a035e839fb2b88



## There are didderent types of Authentications:
		1. Basic Authentication
		2. API Key" 
		3. Bearer Token
		4. OAuth2 (Open Authorization),(Two Factor Authorization)or ( Two Step Verification)



				
				REST ASSURED 
Jackson Databind .. it helps to serialize and deserialize
	when we convert Java to JSon .. serialize
			    JSon to Java .. deserialize


Why do we use Hamcrest library?
to validate out response .. has item,eqial to ,, these methods came from Hamcrest.



Why do we need Testng ?
to be able to use @Test class



under Java we need to create three folder :
	1- Feature
	2- Step Definition
	3- Runner
