What is API ?
	API is a programming language that connect two applications with the help of API two applications can talk to each other.


What do we test in API ?



Which language is used to write API ?
NodeJS



What they do with NodeJS?
They are routing the request and sending the response to the client 



Who develop API ?
API Developer



Who test API ?
API Tester



What tool do we use to test API ?
Postman



When developer develops API ? What they provide to the tester for testing?
testers get an endpoint or address to test.


API Testing process :
	1. Analyzing the story
	2. Analyzing the A/C
	3. Analyzing the Swagger Doc
	4. Analyzing the mapping Doc
	5. Writing test scenarios and test cases
	6. Creating test data/set up environment
	7. Once we get the build in our environment, we excute test cases.



What are the component to send a post request?
1. Endpoint / URL 
2. Headers "Authorization"
3. Body "Payload"


Example of URl :
BaseURL-Path Parameter"folder" ? query Parameter "filtering"



What API you used?
Rest "Architecture" API or Restfull API


SOAP is also an API but it is a protocol "Rules"



What are the types of API?
1. Public API 
2. Parameter API 
3. Internal API 



What is Header?
extra source of information for each API call
When developers create an API, he adds some particular key and value 
that needs to be added to each req to get the server response
Language JSon , Cashes , Cookies and Project Info



What is Body?
When we need to send Data to the API, we send it as a request body like POST and PUT to send the resource



WHat is Payload?
The data the we send from Post request.
The data that we send in a post req in a response body we send and receive Payload




What is Health Check in API?
To check the minimum variable health of API, we can send a GET request that respond back if the server available.


What are the HTTP requests you used for an API?
GET
POST
PUT
PATCH
DELETE




Deference between Put and Patch?
PUT: is a technique that Update the whole resource
Patch : is to change a particular resource.



			2XX Series -- Successful
		200 -- Successfully OK
		201 -- Successfully Created
		204 -- Successfully Connected but no Content Available

			4XX Series -- Unsuccessful because of the request error
		400 -- Very Bad Request
		401 -- Unouthorized Request
		404 -- Requested Resource not found "problem with Path Parameter"

			5XX series -- Problem With The Server Level
		500 -- Server Error "entered the server but the server has some problems handling the request"
		504 -- Getway Timeout "tried to connected with the server and at one point it returns getway timout"




### What do we validate in API?
1- we validate data code
2- we validate statues String (ok, created, very bad request)
3- if we need to validate any particular String
4- We validate Feild and Value
5- Checking response header content type
6- Check if the response time is less that 200ms





					Reqress Collection Tests
	A. List Users "Get Method"
		1- Test Case 001 - Verify that the user get 200 response in a Get Method
		2- Test Case 001 - Verify that the status code name has String OK
		3- Test Case 003 - Verify that length of users of page2 is 6
		4- Test Case 004 - Verify that the user in page2
		5- Test Case 005 - Verify that Byron is included in my string Byron
		6- Test Case 006 - Verify that Content Type is Present
		7- Test Case 007 - Response time is less than 200ms
		8- Test Case 008 - Verify that the response time is less that 200ms
